Then, just follow the [Quality Attributes Slides](../theory/6.1%20MEIC-ASSO-2024%20Quality%20Attributes.pdf) to get a good overview of the most important quality attributes. After page 24, there's some gold to be seen, it could be used as reference when asking what would be the best quality attributes for a given system, since they have examples.
